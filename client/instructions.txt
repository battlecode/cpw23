WRITING YOUR BOT:

Put all of your code into the Competitor class of competitor.py.
The play_turn method will be called once per turn, and your bot will take the
action assigned at the end of its turn. This allows you to select an action and
choose to override it before the function call ends and your turn locks in.
Each team starts with 3 bots, with indices 0, 1, 2. 

The actions a bot can take are:
    - Loading. This gives a bot 1 ammo which it can use to deal 1 damage to an enemy bot.
    - Launching. This takes in a target enemy bot and an amount of ammo and deals that amount of damage 
                to the enemy bot.
    - Shielding. The selected bot shields themselves, meaning they take 3 less damage total that round from enemy attacks.
                 Enemy attacks can 'stack' to break the shields (like dealing 2 and 2 damage to a shielded target will take 1 health).

Bots cannot take actions while dead. Attempting to take an invalid action will instead do nothing, with the error documented in 
get_prev_round_errors. If your code takes longer than 1 second to run play_turn, its turn will end and do nothing.

Games that last greater than 250 rounds will automatically end and be considered a tie.
