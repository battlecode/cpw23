# Game Rules

Battlecode-o7 is a two player game based on the popular hand game, [007 (also known as James Bond or Standoff)](https://ludocity.org/wiki/Standoff_(hand_game)).

In our version, each player controls 3 bots and each bot has 5 health. 

The game plays out as a series of rounds. 

In each round, all bots simultaneously act out one of three choices:
* Attack an opponent with some amount of ammo
* Load one ammo
* Shield
    - Gain a temporary 3 health for this turn. Attacks performed on this bot will first drain shield health and then bot health.

After the round ends, bots with 0 health can take no further actions.
